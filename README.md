Dins was created over a three-week period for Ada Developer Academy's final Capstone. 

The goal of Dins is to help users and their friends determine where to go for dinner. Users join a session with a friend and are provided with a card stack of restaurants based on their location. 
Users swipe left/right to indicate if they like/dislike a restaurant. When a user and their friend(s) swipe right on a restaurant, it's a match! It's time for dins.
